Immutablization

- memoize metaclass info
- resolve all _super calls directly
- generate optimized constructor
- spit out entire class as generated coffeescript

Meta protocol

- attribute get/set/predicate/clear as methods which receive an instance -
  currently inline only

- instance metaclass - could do inside-out objects in JS too

- local vs inherited attributes, methods, modifiers, etc.

C3 inheritance algorithm - eventually, but multiple inheritance is not so
important with roles

Something like Moose::Util::MetaRole for apply metaroles
